# Project-Euler

Here is why I am choosing to publish these solutions.

Project Euler states on their website,
"There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself."

I agree: there is nothing like the "Aha!" moment, and spoilers are impolite. However, I think that the nature of Github leads to some mitigating factors:

1. Github is a site with a strong focus on coding. I am choosing to use it as such, and I'm publishing my code, rather than a simple "the answer is x" crib sheet.

2. By using coding to solve these problems, I am developing useful code snippets and improving my skillset as a result. These solutions are good examples of problem solving with code, and also provide a useful retrospective of my development as a coder. Other coders may be able to draw useful insights from this process.

3. Visiting a repository on Github is a voluntary act. By choosing to view a file that is clearly labeled as a Project Euler solution, a visitor has knowingly exposed themselves to "spoilers". If a visitor does not want to read the solution, the answer is as simple as refusing to click the view link.

I do not feel that providing my code examples in this context is violating the spirit of Project Euler. While doing so makes it possible (and indeed, easy) for someone to copy my work, a person who chooses to do so is making the decision to cheat themselves out of the joy of problem solving. I am not posting these solutions in a public, uncensored forum, and I am being very clear about the fact that they *are* solutions. I think that it is reasonable to expect that an individual who wishes to avoid spoilers will manage to do so, without being irresistibly drawn to read my code on Github against their will.

A final point: while imitating the behavior of others is not a justification, I will note that, at the time of this writing (01/04/2018), a search on Github for "Project Euler" returns 26,544 repository results. If publishing my solutions is going to poison the well, then they are surely no more than a drop in the bucket.
